# SearchEngine
Object Oriented Design

This project will be a simple demonstration of a search engine 
that is built by utilizing Object Oriented Design

Currently the database that is being searched is a collection of all nonfiction book titles within the Duke Library that I found online. The list is not ordered.

How the search algorithm currently functions is by checking all of the words within a user's input, checking the frequency of the inputted words with every title in the database, then outputing the results that have the highest relevancy rating. The algorithm adds less relevance to prepositions and articles within input to help increase accuracy.


Code needs to be cleaned up, just a fast and dirty search implementation.
